React.js assignment for school.

This is a mock social media site using React.js and React Router

The landing page is Newsfeed, it contains hard-coded posts that can be edited and deleted. No option to edit image on post yet. There is a form to create a new post without image as well.
The Charts page was created using Recharts.
The Friends page and Messages pages were created using Randomuser API
The Gallery page is a collection of some of my personal photos.

Modal is included for previewing images from Gallery

The avatar in the header also acts as a link to the Settings page
The Settings page > User Profile has content pulled from Randomuser API, the remaining links are dead at the moment.
